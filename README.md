# Getting Started with Custom Hooks

In this exercise I have developed a custom hook to toggle a boolean value, it would be used as follows:
```
const [ value, toggleValue ] = useToggle(false);
```

More information [here](https://es.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install` and `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
